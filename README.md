# Hovering Stars

basic starscape to test the 2D to 3D interaction when hovering

## Commands:

`npm run start` - runs the dev server
`npm run build` - creates a production version of the code
`npm run docs` - generated the documentation

`npm run release` - builds the code and docs

The build is called `stars.js` and can be found in the `dist` folder after using the build command.
The docs can be found in the `docs` folder, and the docs command regenerates them if you make changes.
